# JTAG-learning
This project demonstrates how to use the JTAG interface to send data to an FPGA and display the received number on GPIO-connected output devices such as LEDs or a 7-segment display. It serves as a learning tool to understand low-level communication through JTAG and how to interface hardware components in an FPGA environment.
